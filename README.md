### üôã About The Technologies Used
This project includes both JEST and Cypress for testing the code and the interface. The project is built on top of Docker, which makes it easily portable.

## üöÄ Run The Project Locally
To start with, you can clone this repo pasting the following command in a shell:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ch3ssMaster/password-generator.git
```
To continue, I recommend you to `maintain the original file package-lock.json` and install the node packages with the following command:
```sh
npm ci
```
Once the installation has finished, you can launch the app with the following command: 
```sh
npm start
```
The password generator will run in the URL: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).

## üê≥ Run The Project With Docker
The easiest way to run this project. Download the container from Hub (assuming you have docker up and running) with the following command:
```sh
docker pull ch3ssmaster/agile
```
Then, you can launch the container and open it in the browser ([http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000)):
```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ch3ssmaster/agile
```
üì£	** You must to use port 3000 in order to be able of executing Cypress tests.**

## üß™ Run The Tests
For launching the JEST test run the following command:
```sh
npm run j-w
```
To execute Cypress tests in navigator mode run: 
```sh
npm run c-open
```
While running in navigator mode, you will need to confirm the copy-to-clipboard action by pressing the `"Accept"` button, in the pop-up window.
You can also run Cypress in shell mode:
```sh
npm run c-run
```

### üí° Using The Password Generator
In the `"Home"` section, you can set up the security parameters for your password, choosing to include uppercase, lowercase and numbers (by default, only lowers). In addition, you can choose a password length between 6 and 16 characters (12 by default). Press `"Generate Password"` to generate a new one.

The `"Hit to copy"` button will copy your password to the clipboard, and now you can move to the `"Password Checker"` section to verify the strength of your generated password. Of course, you can test whatever password that you desire. The validator will give you sympathetic feedback.
